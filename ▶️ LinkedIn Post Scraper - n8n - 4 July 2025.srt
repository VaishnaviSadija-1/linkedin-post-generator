00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:04,858
This is Varsha V. Neal Sudeja. I've recently completed my BTEC in Computer

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,802
Science from VIT Willow, and I'm here to explain my Lingman Postscraper,

3
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:14,473
which I've built using Anatem. So this Lingman Postscraper analyzes

4
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:19,123
top posts posted by users. on LinkedIn for some particular marketing of

5
00:00:19,124 --> 00:00:22,917
their brands. Uh, after analyzing these posts,

6
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:27,632
it converts them into a founder-style posts that

7
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:30,287
will market our brand. So it,

8
00:00:30,288 --> 00:00:35,181
uh, basically helps us get more reactions on our posts and attract people.

9
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,498
So, uh, we start with a manual trigger here.

10
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:42,656
Uh, once this is, uh,

11
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:45,940
done, uh, we move on to a Google Sheet that I've given.

12
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:48,511
So this of,

13
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:53,015
uh, founders, uh, that market their brands with their LinkedIn URLs.

14
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,152
So, uh, then we move on to this HTTP node,

15
00:00:57,463 --> 00:01:00,251
which connects it with API to scrape the bot.

16
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:02,868
Once the scraping is done,

17
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:05,534
it pens this into the Google Sheet,

18
00:01:05,535 --> 00:01:09,052
which is here, uhh, and the same sheet on a different tab.

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,836
So, here all the data will be available in it.

20
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:14,017
Once the data has been appended,

21
00:01:14,018 --> 00:01:17,838
uhh, we move on to the Lanchine's LLM chain,

22
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:22,211
to which I have given a prompt saying you were rolling and goes right

23
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:25,991
over a clothing brand. And it has to,

24
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:30,912
uhh, uhh, take out post into the hook type and hook example

25
00:01:30,913 --> 00:01:33,434
text. And there should be the output.

26
00:01:37,038 --> 00:01:39,971
Uhh, once this is done, it's uhh, uhh, passed using the,

27
00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:42,245
output password, using Google Chennai.

28
00:01:43,294 --> 00:01:45,828
Then again, we use this L&M chain,

29
00:01:46,237 --> 00:01:50,211
almost saying, you were rolling when you go straight off a start-up called Amplify,

30
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,211
which is a premium clothing drawing plan and here is our what should be

31
00:01:54,212 --> 00:01:57,345
the post come with the post text. So,

32
00:01:57,346 --> 00:02:02,077
this will analyze the post given by the last L&M chain and convert

33
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:04,260
it into a founder-style post,

34
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:10,051
which is, which connects users and which explains our founder's journey.

35
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:13,238
So, uhh. This is how it works.

36
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:19,652
Once this is done, we structured using the output password again

37
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:24,436
and we finally hope

38
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:27,933
it will have the original competitor post and the generated post here.

39
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:35,689
So let's try this out. You

40
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,689
will

41
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:45,944
see that, uhh,

42
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:48,666
apofia is extracted dot text.

43
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:53,384
And then you will- It has appended into the sheet on this format,

44
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:56,443
which we can see here. So here,

45
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:58,611
umm, the text,

46
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,244
the creator and the number of reactions for the all the posts.

47
00:03:04,562 --> 00:03:09,266
So we have this data. Once this is done,

48
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:12,805
we move on to the basic alarm chain,

49
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:15,576
which gives output. In this format,

50
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:20,430
like, uh, heading at the text. Using Google Gemini.

51
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:25,290
Once this is done, the post is being analyzed and converted into

52
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:29,342
a found-is-type post, which can help us brand,

53
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:32,835
uh. Once this is done,

54
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:37,108
it gets appended into the Google Sheet,

55
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:42,585
that we can compare the original post as it was here.
